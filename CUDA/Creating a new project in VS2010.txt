hey CUDA programmers, here a few steps to make a new CUDA project on visual studio 2010 to run the same as we do in visual studio 2008.

I tried it and worked, assuming of course you're already running CUDA, and you have SDK and tools installed...

first you must do this once:
copy files "Cuda.props, Cuda.targets, and Cuda.xml" to:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\VCProjectDefaults
special thanks to Ade Miller for the files


then:
1- create a New Project -> C++ Win32 Console Application -> Empty Project

2- mark the project in the Solution Explorer, then select Project menu -> Build Customizations... CUDA 3.2 or whatever version you're using

3- right click the project in the Solution Explorer and select Properties

4- select General and set the Platform Toolset to v90

5- select VC++ Directories and add to Include Directories:
C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 3.2\C\common\inc

6- select Linker -> General and add to Additional Library Directories:
$(CUDA_PATH)/lib/$(PlatformName);../../common/lib
and
C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 3.2\C\common\lib

7- select Linker -> Input and add to Additional Dependencies:
cudart.lib


8- select Custom Build Step -> General and add to Additional Dependencies:
C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 3.2\C\common\inc

9- now add your .cu file
